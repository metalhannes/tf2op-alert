TF2OP Alert!
============

TF2OP Alert! is a firefox plugin that lets users check the messages they get on TF2Outpost without having to constantly check the site.
New messages can be displayed as little messenger style pop-ups.
Should this be a nuisance, it is possible to just have one pop-up alert the user when there are new messages, or turn them off altogether.
A little status icon in the users addon-bar will display the status of their TF2Outpost activities.
