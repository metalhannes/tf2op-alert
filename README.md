TF2OP Alert!
============

Now you can monitor the messages you get on TF2Outpost without having to constantly check the site!
New messages can be displayed as little messenger style pop-ups.
If you are constantly getting spammed, you can choose to just have one pop-up alert you when there are new messages, or turn them off altogether.
A little status icon in your addon-bar will display the status of your TF2Outpost activities.
